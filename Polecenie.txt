# Task
​
At first, if the task seems too complicated, don’t worry – you’ll find tips at the bottom. 
The task is to write a web app that will fetch list of photos, and display first 3 of them – side by side. 
​
Few things to keep in mind:
​
- Fetch list of photos from this URL: `https://picsum.photos/v2/list`
- To render an image from unsplash you can use `http://source.unsplash.com/{SLUG}` (for example http://source.unsplash.com/yC-Yzbqy7PY)
- You'll find image's `{SLUG}` in the `url`, in the API response (you need to extract it).
- Use whatever technology / library you want (plain JavaScript, React ...)
- It doesn’t have to be multi-browser-compatible, Chrome is enough
- You don't need to care about CSS too much – make it clear, nice and simple
- Create [Github](https://github.com) repository and push the code there
- Publish it so it's accesible online on e.g Github pages, Vercel, Netlify, Heroku etc.
- Send us back a link to the newly created repository and published page.
​
If you want to earn **extra points** you can:
​
- Add a “Next” button. After clicking it the app should display next 3 images (append to the list or replace current)
- Super extra points if you use one of these technologies:
  - ES6
  - React
  - Webpack
  - LESS
​
## Tips
​
### For fetching you can use:
  - [Built-in Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch) (recommended)
  - [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
  - ... or whatever lib you want
